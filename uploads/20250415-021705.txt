This assignment is about building a web application that transcribes audio files and analyzes their sentiment.  You upload a .wav audio file, and the application uses Google's Gemini AI model to generate a text transcription and determine whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. You can then download both the transcription and the sentiment analysis as text files.
