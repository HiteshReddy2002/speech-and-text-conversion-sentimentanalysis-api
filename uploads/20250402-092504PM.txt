Okay, I've analyzed the audio. Here are the results:

1.  **Transcript:**

   "Hmm. I'm disappointed."

2.  **Sentiment Analysis:**

    *   **Overall Sentiment:** Negative
    *   **Explanation:** The speaker explicitly states "I'm disappointed," which is a clear expression of negative sentiment. The initial "Hmm" could also be interpreted as a sound of mild disapproval, further supporting the negative assessment.
