Okay, I've analyzed the provided audio. Here's what I found:

**1. Transcript:**

"Uh, fixed errors and running it again."

**2. Sentiment Analysis:**

*   **Overall Sentiment:** Neutral
*   **Explanation:** The statement "fixed errors and running it again" is primarily descriptive. While there's an implicit suggestion of a problem being addressed ("fixed errors"), the tone and content lack strong positive or negative emotional cues. It simply reports a process of correction and re-execution.
